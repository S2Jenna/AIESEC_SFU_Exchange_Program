# AIESEC SFU Globalytics Hackathon â€“ Winning Project

## Overview
This project was developed during the AIESEC SFU Globalytics Hackathon, where our team secured 1st place. The challenge focused on creating strategic recommendations to increase participation in exchange programs.
I led the data cleaning, analysis, and statistical testing to identify key factors influencing participation rates. Additionally, I independently created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and support our recommendations with data-driven evidence.

## Key Contributions
- Led Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed and structured the provided dataset using Python to ensure accuracy and usability.
- Spearheaded Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover trends and patterns, identifying key factors affecting participation.
- Performed Statistical Testing: Independently carried out t-tests and chi-square tests to determine which factors had the most significant impact on participation rates.
- Created Interactive Power BI Dashboards: Designed and developed the dashboard single-handedly to present insights effectively and showcase our findings in an intuitive manner.
- Developed Strategic Recommendations: Contributed to crafting data-driven solutions, aligning with the goal of increasing exchange program participation.

## Results
Our insights and recommendations led to a winning strategy, earning our team **first place** in the hackathon.
